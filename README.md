# Mian Imad ud Din
Started writing code at the turn of the millennium, and havenâ€™t stopped ever since.
Passionate about coding, learning new technologies, and adapting my skills to the rapidly
changing and growing field of technology. In 2 decades of my experience, I have managed
and led teams to create secure and efficient digital products successfully. Plus, Iâ€™ve
remained a part of Valley-based wonderful tech teams, working for dynamic VC-funded
startups.
